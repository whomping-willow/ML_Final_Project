# ML_Final_Project
This project aims to predict stroke using XGBoost, Logistic Regression and Random Forest. It also uses SMOTE for handling Imbalanced Dataset. To run the code, open the 'Stroke_Pred_ML_Lab.ipynb' in colab using 'Open in Colab' option. Then load the dataset 'stroke-data-outlierRemoved.csv' in your drive and mount drive with colab.
